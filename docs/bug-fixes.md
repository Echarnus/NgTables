# Testing the Fixed NgTable

This document describes the bug fixes implemented to address Issue #39.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pagination Display Bug ✅
**Problem**: Template was displaying all `sortedData()` instead of paginated subset
**Solution**: Changed template to use `paginatedData()` computed signal
**Result**: Now shows correct number of items per page (75 instead of showing all)

### 2. Table Structure - Single Table Element ✅
**Problem**: Frozen columns were in separate table sections causing scrollbar issues
**Solution**: Restructured to use single HTML table with CSS sticky positioning for frozen columns
**Result**: 
- Single table element as required
- Horizontal scrollbar applies to entire table
- Better performance with CSS sticky instead of JavaScript positioning

### 3. Horizontal Scrollbar Positioning ✅
**Problem**: Scrollbar was on individual sections, not entire table
**Solution**: Single table wrapper with overflow-x: auto
**Result**: Scrollbar now covers entire table width

### 4. Dark Theme Support ✅
**Problem**: Dark theme not working properly
**Solution**: Added `.ngt-theme-dark` class support in addition to `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
**Result**: Both automatic dark mode detection and manual class-based toggling

### 5. Simplified CSS Architecture ✅
**Problem**: Complex grid layout with synchronization issues
**Solution**: Single table with sticky positioning
**Result**: Much simpler and more reliable CSS structure
